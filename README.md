This is a practice project to experiment with and improve my HTML and CSS skills.

## About 

This project is a very basic multi-page website, filled mostly with lorem ipsum. My focus was less on content and more on structure. However, I built the structure using the idea of hypothetical blog about my interests. 

## Help, Please!

I'm a relative beginner to web building, so I'm looking for suggestions to make my work look a little more professional. If you have any idea you think will make my project look better, please share!
