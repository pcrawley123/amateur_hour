        <h5>Date and Time Stamp</h5>
        <p>Clara, I'm not your boyfriend. I never said it was your mistake. The Doctor. Nosey parker. If I grow to be half the man that you are, Clara Oswald, then I shall be happy indeed. The waves of time wash us all clean. That could blow a hole in the space-time continuum, the size of—actually, the exact size of Belgium. That's a bit undramatic, isn't it? 'Belgium'? How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two hearts, remember? Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.</p>

        <p>Allons-y! Nine hundred years of time and space, and I've never been slapped by someone's mother. Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? Would you like a jelly baby? Well, who are you boys? Oh, of course! Are you his companions? Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. Our lives are important—at least to us—as we see, so we learn…Our destiny is in the stars , so let's go and search for it. Subject for catalogue: file under 'imagination, comma, lack of'. Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us.</p>
        <p>No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. Then, all things considered...it's time I grew up. Why is there never a big red button? Two wrongs don't make a left turn. Sorry, must dash! People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! Let's go in! Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part. I've reversed the polarity of the Neutron flow, so the TARDIS should be free from the force field now.</p>
