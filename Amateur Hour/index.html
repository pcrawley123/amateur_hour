      <h2>About Me and My Blog</h2>
      <p> I'm the type of person who likes to do a lot of different things. A <em>lot</em> a lot. In my relatively brief life, I have forayed into:
        <ul>
          <li>Fiction Writing</li>
          <li>Journalism</li>
          <li>Computer Programming</li>
          <li>Book Blogging</li>
          <li>Considering Becoming a Social Media Personality</li>
          <li>Knitting</li>
          <li>Sewing</li>
          <li>Watercolour Painting</li>
          <li>Fashion Design</li>
          <li>Photography</li>
          <li>DIY Science</li>
          <li>Various Styles of Dance</li>
          <li>Theatre and Drama</li>
          <li>Foreign Languages</li>
          <li>And Much, Much More</li>
        </ul>
        The unfortunate problem that inevitably accompanies so many varied interests is a lack of any real commitment or mastery in any of them. As a result, I know several conversational phrases in Welsh, I can draw a gray scale in seconds flat, I can build a basic HTML page (like this one!), and I can tap like no one's watching. But if you were to ask me to deliver a Welsh speech, or create a professional-looking webpage, I would be utterly lost. </p>
        <p>But that hasn't stopped me yet. I've always wanted to share what I do with the world, but the knowledge that I have absolutely zero authority eventually shuts me down. Then I realizes something: there are a lot of people who know a lot less than me. And, if I have any luck at all, those people might find they prefer someone a little less informed.</p>
